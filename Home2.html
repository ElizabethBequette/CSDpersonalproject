  <h1> About CSD </h1> 
	<article id="main">

  <p>CSD is a two-year program at Lewis and Clark Career Center where you learn programming and databases. CSD prepares anyone with any skill level to continue on with computer software development in college or a career.
  The Computer Services Industry is growing at a large rate and needs young and talented people with programming and database knowledge. Lewis and Clark sets you apart from the rest of the crowd and sets you up perfectly for a future career.
  After attending Lewis and Clark one year or two years, you will have enough experience to coast through your first year of college with no problem. 
</p>
     <p>Lewis and Clark offers programs and advantages your typical high school does not offer. It allows students to acquire industry certifications while exploring their career interests.
   You are able to make new friends that have similar interests at Lewis and Clark and still stay engaged at your home school with Lewis and Clark's half-day schedule. Each class is generally small with 12-18 students. 
   Each student that attends Lewis and Clark will even set up their resume. This is not something every standard high school offers, because Lewis and Clark is not your average school. It is for those who want to get a head start on their career. 
  Depending on what job or program, you decide to pursue, you can even get a job straight out of Lewis and Clark.
